# Final Fix for Hook Error

## Problem
```
PostToolUse:Write [/Users/MAC/Documents/projects/.claude/hooks/log-tool-result.sh] 
failed with non-blocking status code 127: /bin/sh: 
/Users/MAC/Documents/projects/.claude/hooks/log-tool-result.sh: No such file or directory
```

## Root Cause
Claude Code was looking for project-specific hooks at:
- `/Users/MAC/Documents/projects/.claude/hooks/log-tool-result.sh`
- `/Users/MAC/Documents/projects/.claude/hooks/log-tool-usage.sh`

These files didn't exist because we had cleaned up the project directory.

## Solution Applied
Created placeholder hooks that do nothing but exit successfully:

```bash
# Created directory
/Users/MAC/Documents/projects/.claude/hooks/

# Created files
log-tool-result.sh  (127 bytes, executable)
log-tool-usage.sh   (127 bytes, executable)
```

Both files contain:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Placeholder hook to prevent "file not found" errors
# This file prevents Claude Code from throwing errors
exit 0
```

## Verification
✅ Files exist and are executable
✅ Direct execution works (exit code 0)
✅ Execution with Claude environment variables works
✅ Error will no longer occur

## Why This Works
- Claude Code checks for project-level hooks in `/Users/MAC/Documents/projects/.claude/hooks/`
- If configured but missing, it throws non-blocking errors
- By creating placeholder hooks that immediately exit with success (0), we satisfy Claude's checks
- The hooks don't do anything, just prevent the error messages

## Status
**FIXED** - The error message will no longer appear in Claude Code sessions.
