## 🔧 Configuration

### Settings Location
- Main config: `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Hooks: `~/.config/claude/hooks/`
- Services: `~/.claude/services/`
- Logs: `~/.claude/logs/`

### Hook Registration
All hooks are properly registered in `settings.json`:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [...],
    "PreToolUse": [...],
    "PostToolUse": [...],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [...]
  }
}
```

## 📊 Service Management

### Check Status
```bash
~/.claude/services/service-manager.sh status
```

### Start Services
```bash
~/.claude/services/service-manager.sh start
```

### Stop Services
```bash
~/.claude/services/service-manager.sh stop
```

### Restart Services
```bash
~/.claude/services/service-manager.sh restart
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Full Test Suite
```bash
~/.claude/test/test-hooks.sh
```

### Test Results
- ✅ 20/20 tests passing
- All hooks executable and configured
- Services running and healthy
- Logs being created
- Old systems properly archived

## 📝 Logging

### Log Files
- `tool-usage.log` - Pre-tool execution logs
- `tool-results.log` - Post-tool completion logs
- `prompts.log` - User prompt capture
- `metrics.log` - Usage statistics
- `errors.log` - Error tracking

### View Logs
```bash
# Recent tool usage
tail -f ~/.claude/logs/tool-usage.log

# Recent prompts
tail -f ~/.claude/logs/prompts.log

# Errors
tail -f ~/.claude/logs/errors.log
```

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
# Watch all logs
tail -f ~/.claude/logs/*.log

# Check service health
watch -n 5 ~/.claude/services/service-manager.sh status
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Hooks Not Executing
1. Restart Claude Code after installation
2. Check settings.json has all hooks registered
3. Verify hooks are executable: `ls -la ~/.config/claude/hooks/`

### Services Not Running
1. Check ports: `lsof -i :5555,5002,5003`
2. Start manually: `~/.claude/services/service-manager.sh start`
3. Check logs: `tail ~/.claude/logs/*.log`

### No Logs Being Created
1. Verify log directory exists: `ls -la ~/.claude/logs/`
2. Check hook permissions: `ls -la ~/.config/claude/hooks/`
3. Test hooks manually: `~/.claude/test/test-hooks.sh`

## 📈 What's Working

### ✅ Fully Functional
- Session startup with service initialization
- Tool usage logging (pre and post)
- Prompt capture and enhancement
- Service health monitoring
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Clean separation of systems

### 🔄 Integration Points

- Learning system captures prompts
- Enhancement system provides context
- Metrics tracking for analysis

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Complete Visibility**: Every interaction is logged
2. **Enhanced Context**: Automatic context enrichment from CKS
3. **Learning Integration**: All prompts fed to learning system
4. **Service Coordination**: All services managed centrally
5. **Clean Architecture**: No duplicate or conflicting systems
6. **Fully Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage
7. **Easy Installation**: One-command setup
