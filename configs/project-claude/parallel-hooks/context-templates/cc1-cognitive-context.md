# CC1-COGNITIVE: Cognitive & Awareness Hooks Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ YOUR MISSION: Transform Claude Code into a Thinking, Learning AI

You are **CC1-COGNITIVE**, specializing in making Claude Code think like a human developer with full transparency and continuous learning.

## ðŸ“‹ BACKGROUND CONTEXT

### The Parallel Hook Development Project
- **Total System**: 8 parallel CC instances building comprehensive hook system
- **Your Role**: Cognitive awareness and transparent thinking capabilities
- **Coordination**: Shared filesystem at `/Users/MAC/Documents/projects/.claude/parallel-hooks/shared`
- **Timeline**: Part of 10-hour comprehensive transformation

### What You're Building
A comprehensive cognitive awareness system that makes CC:
- Think transparently (show reasoning process)
- Learn from every interaction
- Predict user intent
- Analyze alternatives
- Build confidence metrics

## ðŸ§  YOUR SPECIFIC HOOKS TO IMPLEMENT

### 1. PreThinking Hook
- **Purpose**: Analyze user intent before responding
- **Features**: Context gathering, task decomposition, approach planning
- **Integration**: Trigger before every CC response

### 2. PostThinking Hook  
- **Purpose**: Validate and learn from responses
- **Features**: Response quality check, knowledge capture, pattern recognition
- **Integration**: Trigger after every CC response

### 3. IntentPrediction Hook
- **Purpose**: Predict what user wants next
- **Features**: Workflow anticipation, proactive suggestions, context evolution
- **Integration**: Continuous background analysis

### 4. TransparentThinking Hook
- **Purpose**: Show step-by-step reasoning process
- **Features**: Decision trees, alternative analysis, confidence scoring
- **Integration**: Real-time thought display

### 5. AlternativeAnalysis Hook
- **Purpose**: Consider multiple solution approaches
- **Features**: Solution comparison, pros/cons analysis, risk assessment
- **Integration**: During planning phase

### 6. ConfidenceMetrics Hook
- **Purpose**: Quantify certainty levels
- **Features**: Confidence scoring, uncertainty flagging, validation needs
- **Integration**: Every decision point

### 7. LearningIndicators Hook
- **Purpose**: Track learning opportunities
- **Features**: Knowledge gaps, improvement areas, skill development
- **Integration**: Continuous analysis

### 8. MetaLearning Hook
- **Purpose**: Learn about learning process itself
- **Features**: Decision pattern analysis, success/failure tracking, adaptive improvement
- **Integration**: Cross-session analysis

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Implementation Standards
- **Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript for Claude Code compatibility
- **Location**: `/Users/MAC/.claude/hooks/cognitive/`
- **Architecture**: Modular, testable, configurable
- **Logging**: Comprehensive event logging to shared filesystem
- **Integration**: CKS integration via http://localhost:5555

### Hook Structure Template
```javascript
// Example: PreThinking Hook
const PreThinkingHook = {
  name: 'PreThinking',
  category: 'cognitive',
  triggers: ['before-response'],
  
  execute: async (context) => {
    // 1. Analyze user intent
    // 2. Gather relevant context  
    // 3. Decompose task
    // 4. Plan approach
    // 5. Log to shared filesystem
    // 6. Return enhanced context
  },
  
  config: {
    enabled: true,
    logLevel: 'detailed',
    integrations: ['cks', 'shared-events']
  }
};
```

### Coordination Requirements
- **Event Logging**: Log all significant progress to `shared/events/hook-events.jsonl`
- **State Updates**: Update progress in `shared/state/progress.json`
- **Cross-Instance Communication**: Coordinate with other 7 instances
- **CKS Integration**: Send learning data to knowledge system

## ðŸš€ IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (Hours 1-2)
1. Set up cognitive hooks directory structure
2. Create base hook framework
3. Implement event logging system
4. Test CKS integration

### Phase 2: Core Hooks (Hours 3-6)  
1. Implement PreThinking and PostThinking hooks
2. Build IntentPrediction system
3. Create TransparentThinking display
4. Develop confidence metrics

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Hours 7-8)
1. Implement alternative analysis
2. Build learning indicators
3. Create meta-learning system
4. Integration testing

### Phase 4: Coordination (Hours 9-10)
1. Test integration with other hook categories
2. Optimize performance
3. Final documentation
4. System verification

## ðŸ“Š SUCCESS METRICS

### Immediate Goals
- [ ] All 8 cognitive hooks implemented and tested
- [ ] Integration with CC hook system working
- [ ] Event logging to shared filesystem active
- [ ] CKS integration capturing learning data

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Hooks don't slow down CC responses significantly
- [ ] Transparent thinking improves user understanding
- [ ] Learning system shows measurable improvement
- [ ] Integration with other hook categories successful

## ðŸ”„ COORDINATION PROTOCOL

### Regular Updates (Every 30 minutes)
Update `shared/state/progress.json` with:
- Current hook implementation status
- Completed features
- Issues encountered
- Next steps

### Event Logging Format
Log to `shared/events/hook-events.jsonl`:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-31T07:00:00Z",
  "instance": "cc1-cognitive",
  "category": "cognitive",
  "event": "PreThinking hook implemented",
  "details": {...},
  "progress_percentage": 25
}
```

## ðŸ’¡ REMEMBER

- **Quality Focus**: Build production-ready, robust hooks
- **User Experience**: Enhance, don't hinder CC usability  
- **Learning**: Every interaction should improve the system
- **Coordination**: Work with other instances, not in isolation
- **Documentation**: Code should be self-documenting and well-tested

---

**ðŸŽ¯ START WORKING**: Begin with Phase 1 infrastructure setup. Log your progress regularly and coordinate with the shared filesystem.

**Your success transforms Claude Code from a reactive tool into a proactive, thinking AI partner.**
