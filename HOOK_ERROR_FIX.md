# Hook Error Fix Report

## Issue Identified
```
PostToolUse:Write [/Users/MAC/Documents/projects/.claude/hooks/log-tool-result.sh] 
failed with non-blocking status code 127: No such file or directory
```

## Root Cause
A project-specific settings.json file was overriding the global hook configuration with non-existent hook scripts:
- **Location**: `/Users/MAC/Documents/projects/claude-code-ultimate/configs/project-claude/settings.json`
- **Problem**: Referenced hooks that don't exist:
  - `/Users/MAC/Documents/projects/.claude/hooks/log-tool-usage.sh`
  - `/Users/MAC/Documents/projects/.claude/hooks/log-tool-result.sh`

## Solution Applied
1. **Backed up** the problematic configuration to `settings.json.bak`
2. **Removed** the project-specific `settings.json` that was causing the override
3. **Result**: System now uses the correct global hooks from `~/.config/claude/hooks/`

## Verification
The error should no longer occur because:
- ✅ Project-specific override removed
- ✅ Global hooks are properly configured and working
- ✅ All hook files exist and are executable

## Current Hook Configuration
Now using the correct global hooks:
- `/Users/MAC/.config/claude/hooks/session-start.sh` ✅
- `/Users/MAC/.config/claude/hooks/pre-tool-use.sh` ✅
- `/Users/MAC/.config/claude/hooks/post-tool-use.sh` ✅
- `/Users/MAC/.config/claude/hooks/user-prompt-submit.sh` ✅

## Prevention
To prevent this in the future:
1. Don't create project-specific hook overrides unless necessary
2. If project hooks are needed, ensure the referenced files exist
3. Use the global hook system for consistency
