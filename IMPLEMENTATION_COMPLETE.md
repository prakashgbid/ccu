# Hook System v2.0 Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Summary
Successfully implemented and deployed the complete Hook System v2.0 with all phases completed:

### ‚úÖ Phase Completion Status
1. **Pre-Fix Documentation**: Created comprehensive backups
2. **Phase 1**: Cleaned up conflicting hook systems

- **PreToolUse**: Validates operations before execution  
- **PostToolUse**: Captures results for learning
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Enhances prompts with context

### ü§ñ Service Integration
- **CKS API Bridge** (port 5555): Knowledge system integration
- **Enhancement System** (port 5002): 16 enhancement systems
